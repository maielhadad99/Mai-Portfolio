# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Linear_Regression_Project.git)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- **Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn

- **Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

- **Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in 73% accuracy .

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Logistic_Regression_Project..git)

<img src="images/bank image.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in 86% accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Knn_Nb_Project.git)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of 82% .

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[The data contains observations of about 240 million clicks, and whether a given click resulted in a download or not ](https://github.com/maielhadad99/DT_Ensemble_Project.git)

<img src="images/Mobile.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,XGboost Classifier, BaggingClassifier

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement  with an accuracy of 99% .

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of the salary and benefitspaid to City employees since fiscal year 2013](https://github.com/maielhadad99/Clustring_Project.git)

<img src="images/clusters.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,Elbow method, K means cluster algorithm

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify 3 clusters from the dataset .

- Used the  K means cluster algorithm to classify the number of clusters the can be formed from the data
- Compared predictive performance by using  a elbow method to the data
